Availity

1. My proudest professional achievement has been taking ownership of multiple features. Reflecting on features I've "taken ownership" of shows me how far I have come since starting my career.

I was able to take ownership to implement a feature a client wanted regarding a tilt tray (A large conveyor that has trays on the conveyor that tilt to both sides.  The way the software worked was that in order to induct (place a stock keeping unit (SKU) onto the tilt tray - was to have a container that owned that sku.  If the SKU ever became orphaned(containerless) ,then it would require user interaction to be able to "reinduct" (find a container in the system, locate it physically, and then induct it -- VERY TIME CONSUMING)

I was able to make it so if there was demand for the SKU on the loop, it would go to a designated chute (destination for SKUs)
This reduced the number of pallets that had to be physically moved around the 1 million + square foot warehouse. (Reduced the # pallets by 90% from around 200 pallets a day to around 20)
Autobagger, Configurable Label Change, QuadChute (what I talked about above) to name a few I'm "Proud of" -- can mostly noting here incase asked in the future I can reference this.




2. I'm currently working my way through two books (really trying to make time as I'm not a big reader but it's something I'd like to spend more time doing.

The Intelligent Investor:
I've been investing since I was a teenager and looking to take a more stock based approach to my portfolio and it can be overwhelming when trying to "pick" good stocks.  This book is about "value" investing

The Pragmatic Programmer:
I am seeking a new role to grow as an individual contributor to reach my (current) 5-10 year plan of becoming a software architecture - I figured reading this highly recommended book couldn't hurt?



3. From my understanding of what "Availity" does (Which if I have a poor understanding then it would be hard to explain to my grandma so...)
Availity tries to bridge the gap between health care providers and the payers (I think that is the insurance companies but it could be direct consumer im unclear to be honest..)
By increasing visibility and bringing this process into the 21st century.
